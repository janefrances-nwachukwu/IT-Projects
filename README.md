## Project Topic: Automating Common IT Tasks
### Objective:
To develop and deploy PowerShell scripts to manage an IT corporate network by automating common administrative tasks on a Windows operating system and maintaining a secure and organized system
### Project Description:
Tasked with creating multiple PowerShell scripts to automate system monitoring, user management, file management, and network configuration tasks. These scripts monitors system events, manage users, backup files, and configure networks.
### Task Performed:
* Monitored system events: Implemented a script that monitors security logs and generates a report file containing filtered security events.
* Managed users:Implemented a script that adds multiple users, sets their passwords, and assigns them to groups.
* Backed Up files:Implemented a script that automatically creates backups of files from a specific directory to another location.
* Configured network:Implemented a script that sets a static IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server for a network adapter.
### Steps to be followed:
* Evaluated strategies for automating system monitoring.
* Analyzed methods to optimize user management.
* Created a streamlined process for file management
* Designed an approach for network configuration
### Tools Used:
* Windows Server 2022 VM
* Powershell
* Note Pad
### Deliverables:
Multiple PowerShell scripts that automate common administrative tasks and generate output files.
### Conclusion and Industry Relevance:
In modern IT environments, efficiency, scalability, and security are critical. Manual execution of routine administrative tasks increases the risk of human error, wastes valuable time, and makes it difficult to maintain consistent security practices across systems. By automating these tasks with PowerShell, this project demonstrates how IT teams can:
* Enhance Security Monitoring: Automated log collection and reporting ensures timely detection of suspicious activity, supporting incident response and compliance requirements.
* Improve User Management: Scripting account creation and group assignments reduces onboarding time and enforces standardized access controls.
* Streamline File Management: Automated backups safeguard sensitive data, ensuring business continuity and resilience against data loss.
* Simplify Network Configuration: Configuring network adapters through scripts minimizes misconfiguration risks and ensures consistent deployment across multiple devices.
  
This project highlights the industry relevance of automation in system administration, showing how PowerShell can be leveraged as a practical tool for IT operations, compliance, and cybersecurity readiness. It reflects real-world practices where enterprises use scripting to improve efficiency, reduce risk, and enforce policy consistency across their infrastructure.
